## üß† Overview

**SCHOLAR_RISC-V** is a learning-oriented project designed to guide you step-by-step through the inner workings of a processor, using the **RISC-V architecture** as a foundation.

This repository serves both as a reference and a hands-on exploration of processor design, architecture, and optimization.

The current version represents the most basic implementation of the core ‚Äî intended as a solid foundation for future enhancements.
It is a **monocycle** and **single-issue** design that supports only the **RV32I instruction set, along with the mcycle CSR** (used for CycleMark benchmarking).<br>
This reflects the minimum functional and performance baseline that a RISC-V core can offer, and serves as the perfect starting point for exploring architectural improvements.

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture, Limitations and Next Steps

Please refer to the [architecture](docs/architecture/README.md) document for detailed information about the current architecture and what causes its limitations.

<br>
<br>

### Current Architecture

The current architecture represents the most basic implementation of a processor.<br>
It follows a straightforward 4-steps process to execute instructions, without any performance optimizations or parallelism.

It is a **monocycle, single-issue RISC-V core** that supports only the minimal instruction set required to run a program ‚Äî namely, **RV32I plus the mcycle CSR** (used for CycleMark benchmarking).<br>
For now, and to simplify the learning path, we assume that memory is ideal ‚Äî able to deliver any instruction or data in a single cycle. Therefore, no cache is currently required.<br>
This assumption is mostly valid for microcontroller-class processors, which typically do not implement complex memory hierarchies.<br>

This version of the processor serves as the starting point of the project and will be progressively enhanced.

<br>
<br>

### Limitations

The current core has the following limitations:

| Max Frequency (MHz) | CycleMark/MHz | Number of Supported Threads |
|---------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| 55                  | 1.24         | 1                           |

<br>

Comparison data (CoreMark scores, which CycleMark is derived from) can be found here: [ARM Cortex-M Comparison Table](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Arm%20Developer%20Community/PDF/Cortex-A%20R%20M%20datasheets/Arm%20Cortex-M%20Comparison%20Table_v3.pdf).
<br>
<br>

### Next Setps

The first step toward improvement will focus on **reducing the critical path and increasing the maximum operating frequency by inserting additional synchronous elements into the core**.<br>
This technique is known as **pipelining**.

There are two main reasons for this choice:

- First, in my opinion, frequency optimization is the best illustration of the principle that everything comes with a cost. It can be silicon area, power consumption, design complexity, or other trade-offs. We will see that improving frequency has many consequences. Fortunately, as we will see, these challenges can be addressed with appropriate architectural techniques.

- Second, once the frequency has been optimized in a first pass (we will later see that several optimization steps will be needed to reach ~300‚ÄØMHz), any further enhancements like IPC or instruction set extensions will have a more significant impact ‚Äî especially since frequency is often the first victim of these upgrades.

## üß≠ Project Organization

The repository follows a microarchitecture-based branching model:

- The main branch contains the most advanced version of the RISC-V core, including the latest validated microarchitecture improvements.

- ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) features will not have dedicated branches, as they are independent of the microarchitecture and can be integrated into any implementation developed throughout the project.
Each branch will explicitly specify the supported ISA.

- Branches correspond to specific development steps. Each one isolates a particular microarchitectural enhancement, making it easy to understand design trade-offs and follow the core‚Äôs evolution.

- Additional branches may exist for specialized adaptations (e.g., embedded or resource-constrained versions).

- Tags are used to mark major milestones or stable releases for easier navigation and version tracking.

<br>

## üêû Known Issues

- **Yocto Build Failures** 

While trying to build a Linux image for the MPFS DISCOVERY KIT, Yocto may occasionally fail to fetch some external dependencies, leading to a Linux build failure.<br>
If this happens, simply rerun the build process **without cleaning** it:

```bash
make mpfs_discovery_kit_linux
```

Yocto will resume from where it left off and attempt to fetch the missing files again.

<br>
<br>

- **Firmware Switching and Memory Corruption**

On the MPFS DISCOVERY KIT, running different firmwares successively may cause shared memory corruption between the platform and the core.
If this occurs, reprogramming the FPGA with the latest bitstream usually solves the problem:
```bash
make mpfs_discovery_kit_bitstream program=1
```
‚ö†Ô∏è The issue is under investigation and will be fixed in a future update.
